** Description
  Manage a list of instruments from several facilities by using Google
  Doc as a storage backend. There is one spreadsheet by facility and
  an extra one listing the facilities. These Google Docs have to be
  readable (share/read-only) and published to the web as rss
  (file>publish).

  This project can serve as an example of use of the Google Docs as a
  online basic database.

** Files
*** facilitydb.js 
    Process the information and generate a page. Contains the code for
    grabbing the feeds from the google docs.
*** index.html
    A simple example of use.
